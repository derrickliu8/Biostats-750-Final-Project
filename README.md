# Biostats-750-Final-Project

Data visualization --> do this first before diving into performing all methods before!

Logistic regression on the target variable (as the response)
Possibly doing LDA and QDA
Using ridge regression or lasso methods

13 predictor variables --> we suspect that not all of them will be significant in predicting whether a heart attack will occur or not

Variable selection methods --> then plug the result of that into logistic regression, LDA, QDA, etc.
